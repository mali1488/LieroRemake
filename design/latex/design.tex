\section{Scenarios}
\label{sec:label}
\subsection{Persona 1}
Liam wants to play a new game that his friend has told him about. It is called Stickiero. He downloads the demo on his computer and starts playing. He found the controls pretty easy to understand since he has used keyboard and mouse before. His mom walks in on him and sees him playing Stickero. She is horrified by the amount of blood displayed on the screen. She tells Liam to stop playing this horrible game and go to his room.
\subsection{Persona 2}
Anders is Liams older brother. He heard the fight between Liam and his mother about some game being brutal. He downloads this game on his own computer and tries it out. He has played the original game Liero before. He finds that the graphic is better and the amount of blood satisfies him. But the controls are made too easy he thinks. It is too easy to aim and hit the other player. He feels like there should be a mode where you can have the original controls.
\subsection{Persona 3}
Anna is Liams and Anders mother. She decides to try the game out so she can decide if Liams should be allowed to play the game. She founds it very violent, especially with all the blood. But she found there is a parental version of the game on the Internet which does not contain any blood. She decides that Liam will be playing the parental version of the game. She does not find the gamy specially fun to play since she could not figure out how to play the game. She feels like there should have been a tutorial that explains how to play the game and what to do in the game.
